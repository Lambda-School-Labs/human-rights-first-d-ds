She told the officers ""I live here"" and ""I'm allowed to be on my own property;"" the officer responded (in a cheerful tone of voice) ""You're on the sidewalk. You guys think you know.

az-tempe-1,Police pepper spray protesters on sidewalk,Tempe,Arizona,,,2020-06-27,"On June 27th, protesters gathered on the sidewalk for a 'chalk walk' protest.

Full footage from instagram shows police chasing, tackling, kneeling on and arresting a protester. Police refused to answer when protesters asked why they were being arrested. At 2:20 in the instagram video, the filmer asks why the protester was tased, but this appears to be erroneous; the protester was pepper-sprayed.

Police then attempted to clear the protesters from the sidewalk into the lawn of a shopping center. One protester remained seated and police manhandled her.

Several protesters, including the filmer, shouted at the police for treating the protester roughly. The officer then told these protesters to back up. They obeyed. The officer then pepper sprayed them repeatedly as they walked away. Police continued to harass protesters, pushing them from the sidewalk to the lawn. It is unclear why police asserted the sidewalk was an unacceptable place to stand.

From an article in the Arizona Mirror, Tempe police are allowed to use pepper spray ""against violent or non-compliant subjects, and on vicious animals."" In addition, they must give verbal warning that they will escalate. No such warning was given.","[{'url': 'https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1277432629353238535', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://www.instagram.com/tv/CB91jGvh25c/', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://www.azmirror.com/2020/06/28/tempe-pd-pepper-sprayed-demonstrators-at-saturday-chalk-walk-protest/', 'text': ''}]"

wi-milwaukee-2,Police use excessive force to disperse protesters,Milwaukee,Wisconsin,,,2020-06-02,"Protesters had congregated near the intersection of North 6th Street and McKinley Avenue. Over the course of about an hour, police moved forward, dispersing the protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, first pushing the protesters a block and a half then pushing them off of North 6th Street entirely. Video shows police shooting rubber bullets at protesters on a sidewalk and firing gas canisters, in large number, at a small group of peaceful protesters. (At least some tear gas was used, but it is unclear how much. Police say they also used smoke canisters.)

Police claim they used force to disperse the crowd after rocks and glass were thrown at them. Police also said at the time that ""Molotov cocktails"" were thrown at them. They later walked that statement back to say that one Molotov Cocktail was thrown. They say it did not ignite. Media and protesters present say they saw water bottles being thrown, but not glass, rocks, or a Molotov cocktail. Video released by police clearly shows something being thrown at police, but doesn't show what it was. Police also produced a picture of a crushed water bottle and what looks like a water pump and implied it was the remnants of a Molotov cocktail.

ut-cottonwoodheights-1,Police beat and pepper spray protesters during violent arrests,Cottonwood Heights,Utah,,,2020-08-02,"During a protest on August 2nd over Zane James who was killed by police a few years ago, police blocked off a residential road, down which protesters were travelling. Police then ordered protesters to the sidewalk. It is difficult to ascertain how the scuffle began; both protesters and police place the blame on the other. It appears that one officer and one protester got into a verbal altercation, after which the two go to the ground, grappling. The officer ends up holding the protester down, but it is difficult to determine how the incident began. This protester was apparently the father of Zane James. After this, protesters and police both became agitated and the scuffle escalated.

Police made 9 arrests, including the father of Zane James. Police beat multiple protesters with batons and pepper sprayed others. A Cottonwood Heights city councilwoman stated she was struck by police. Police state that one officer was choked to the point of unconsciousness and another was hospitalized. In addition, police state protesters used a water gun filled with ""pepper and bodily fluids;"" protesters state they were full of water in order to keep cool.

ca-losangeles-19,Police arrest protesters en masse and detain them in poor conditions,Los Angeles,California,,,2020-06-01,"Police arrested protesters en masse in downtown Los Angeles. Protesters hands were zip tied excessively tightly behind their backs and they were loaded onto buses and driven around the city. Some were taken to a temporary field jail at UCLA's Jackie Robinson stadium; UCLA claims it ""failed to stop"" LAPD from using the stadium as a ""staging area,"" but was not told about the field jail until after the fact. Arestees were detained for long periods, still in excessively tight zip ties. Social distancing procedures were not observed.

Many protesters allege that conditions in the makeshift jails were poor -- detainees denied medical attention and permission to use the restroom, for instance -- and that they were released, many with dead phones, in unfamiliar places in the middle of the night with no way to get home. Two arrestees allege that police prevented them from leaving before the curfew went into effect, then arrested them for violating the curfew. One arrestee alleges that she was twice threatened with guns, that she was sexually assaulted by police, and that police mocked detainees having panic attacks. Police also allegedly arrested at least one homeless person (to whom the curfew was not supposed to apply) for a curfew violation.

A lawsuit has been filed in connection with these and other abuses by the National Lawyers' Guild; a separate lawsuit has been filed by one of the arrestees.

At least one arrestee alleges that protesters were given explicit permission to remain past the curfew, then arrested for being out after curfew. Many arrestees say they were released in the middle of the night, without transportation home, in unfamiliar parts of the city.

Several arrestees describe police sexually harassing/assaulting them; other arrestees corroborate these accounts. Two arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because they requested medical attention and other improvements in their conditions, which would constitute first-amendment-protected speech. Four other arrestees report that processing of arrestees on their bus was delayed because some arrestees removed unsafely-tight zip ties using a lighter. All arrestees who have shared accounts mention officers behaving in a mocking, condescending, and unprofessional manner. One arrestee recalls asking officers to turn on bodycams, and officers refusing to do so. If true, this would be a clear violation of LAPD policy. One arrestee allegedly should have been exempt from the curfew as they were returning home from work.

ca-losangeles-40,"Police make violent arrests, including ripping a protester out of his wheelchair and inducing an asthma attack",Los Angeles,California,,,2020-07-15,"Footage shows a scuffle as police arrest protesters. A protester in a wheelchair pushes police away from him. Police then knock him backwards out of his chair. The man attempts to pull himself away. Police close in. The protester grabs the officer's baton, but multiple officers restrain him and take his wheelchair away. One officer drags the chair and appears to knock a wheel loose, which then falls off after the officer scuffles with another protester. The protester who was in the wheelchair passively resists by locking his arms while police arrest him. Body cam footage released by the LAPD shows the man in the wheelchair striking an officer in the face during a physical altercation between the protester and the officer. Notably, the LAPD footage fails to show the lead up to the protester in the wheelchair slapping the officer.

Footage from instagram (second link, fourth in list) shows a man suffering an asthma attack after allegedly being struck in the neck with a baton. The last video in the instagram post appears to show the man on a gurney receiving medical attention. Other videos in the post show police shoving protesters with their hands and with batons. The poster also alleges that police held a woman in a chokehold.

ca-santamonica-2,"Police arrest protesters en masse, confine them for long periods, and improperly zip tie them",Santa Monica,California,,,2020-05-31,"On May 31st, police arrested numerous protesters for curfew violations. These protesters were zip tied and held for long periods, in tight quarters which did not permit social distancing, then released late at night with no way to get home. At least one detainee alleges that detainees were denied medical care and permission to use the restroom.

Zip ties were put on too tight. Police attempted to remove zip ties with a long knife (which is not the appropriate tool). This led to multiple protesters being injured, including one who required 21 stitches; it seems unlikely that the knife was appropriately sterilized between uses, raising the possibility of bloodborne pathogen transmission.

One protester, who has lived in Santa Monica since high school, states police dropped him and other protesters off outside town late at night. Police then told him he would be arrested if he returned to Santa Monica.

An officer in the city of Vallejo was inside his car when he shot Sean Monterrosa on Monday night amid local and national protests against police brutality. Police said an officer mistakenly believed Monterrosa had a gun, but later determined he had a hammer in his pocket... 'When confronted by the police, he dropped to his knees and surrendered, and they fired at him,' said Melissa Nold, a Vallejo civil rights attorney representing Monterrosa’s family.

Six officers fired 55 bullets in 3.5 seconds; police investigation determined this use of force 'reasonable.'

Vallejo PD has posted composite video containing body cam footage, radio chatter with Dispatch and prior footage of Walgreen's security cameras being destroyed. This footage shows a car with alleged looters peeling out of the Walgreens as police arrive; this car strikes an unmarked police vehicle and continues. Police open the doors of their unmarked van and fire on Monterrosa immediately and without warning.

Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to ""get the fuck back -- get back."" It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.

NOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers. Tattoo artists are not essential, so Walker's arrest was likely lawful, though officers unnecessarily escalated the situation as they were arresting him.","[{'url': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CA6Aa5TB1Ml/', 'text': 'Instagram post'}, {'url': 'https://instagram.fric1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t50.2886-16/100852726_279345510107610_3998981863448833499_n.mp4?_nc_ht=instagram.fric1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=YFSefphKcIYAX_M32_q&oe=5F09000E&oh=6775ecc754bbee9e3d7929587e31bf72', 'text': 'Video from Instagram post'}, {'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/gutrgk/cincinnati_police_arrest_working_painting_shop/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share', 'text': 'Corresponding Reddit post'}, {'url': 'https://www.fox19.com/2020/06/03/cincy-tattoo-artist-says-curfew-arrest-was-bait-and-switch-by-police/#:~:text=Jamison%20Walker%20works%20at%20a,wide%20curfew%20went%20into%20effect.', 'text': 'Fox 19 Coverage'}, {'url': 'https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/cincinnati/local-tattoo-artist-arrested-with-protesters-despite-not-being-involved', 'text': 'WCPO Coverage'}, {'url': 'https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/05/30/cincinnati-curfew-protest-george-floyd-what-you-need-to-know/5295220002/', 'text': 'Curfew exempts essential workers, not all workers'}]"

The ACLU has raised concerns that these arrests are inhibiting freedom of the press, while Louisville Metropolitan Police Department has stated that the department ""has no issue with anyone livestreaming.

The journalist from MilkyMess TV took 1st person footage of their arrest. Around 1:50:00 in her Facebook live post, she is wandering around a crowd of protesters on the sidewalk.

il-chicago-30,Police surround protesters and search their bags,Chicago,Illinois,,,2020-08-15,"At a protest on August 15th, police kettled protesters at West Marble Place and South LaSalle Street. Police refused to allow protesters to leave without a bag search. Officers took protesters' bags and dumped them onto the sidewalk.

The 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives individuals the right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches. Most warrantless searches are considered unreasonable, with the exception of searches with consent of the searched or with probable cause. By disallowing protesters to leave, police did not allow protesters to consent. Further, probable cause has been determined on several occassions to be individualized, meaning that individuals on the premises of a crime scene cannot be searched simply for being present; rather, probable cause must be established for each individual, as in [Ybarra v. Illinois](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/78-5937) and [United States v. Di Re](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/332/581/). This means that, in order to search protester's belongings, police would have needed to establish probable cause for each protester searched.

The Terry standard does allow police to briefly detain and search an individual on reasonable suspicion, which has a lower bar than probable cause. In [Terry v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that police may stop and frisk - which is limited to an external pat down (e.g. for an readily-usable weapon), but does not include bag searches - an individual on the basis of reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion is defined in the case as the reasonable suspicion that an individual may have committed, be committing, or is about to commit a crime. There must additionally be the reasonable belief that the individual is armed and dangerous. In addition, this reasonable suspicion is individualized, so police must have established reasonable suspicion that each protester searched was both armed and engaged in, had engaged in, or was going to engage in criminal conduct.

After reviewing the rights of protesters, it appears that police conducted these searches illegally, abusing their power to prevent protesters from leaving.","[{'url': 'https://twitter.com/DominicGwinn/status/1294792483772268550', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/DominicGwinn/status/1294794798394638344', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://twitter.com/jttv1005/status/1294846222159753221', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/ibjw38/chicago_police_kettle_protestors_and_make_them/', 'text': ''}]"

He appears to begin bleeding from his ear and passes out.

Buffalo P.D. released an official statement saying that he ""tripped and fell."" After video of the incident surfaced, however, both officers were suspended, an internal affairs investigation was opened, and both officers were charged with assault. In response to the suspension, the Buffalo Emergency Response Team [resigned from their posts](https://nypost.com/2020/06/05/buffalo-emergency-response-team-quits-in-solidarity-of-cops/). At first, the two officers were suspended without pay, but because the Buffalo police contract only allows suspension without pay for 30 days, they are now (as of July 10) suspended with pay.

The man suffered brain damage and has begun physical therapy.

ia-iowacity-1,Iowa State Police use tear gas & flashbangs against crowd of civilians attempting to enter I-80 and later against Iowa City EMS.,Iowa City,Iowa,,,2020-06-03,"State police shoot tear gas into, and deploy flashbangs against, a crowd of peaceful protesters attempting to enter I-80. Some protesters stumble and fall as they try to flee.

Reportedly,  one protester suffered seizures as a result of a flashbang, and an ambulance was called to the scene.

Police continued to deploy tear gas and flashbangs in the area where Iowa city EMT's were working (see flashing white lights in cloud of gas, 5th link). Unclear if they were aware of EMS presence.

According to the mayor, Iowa State Patrol was in command of the scene (though some Iowa City Police were present) and it was determined that letting the protest onto I-80 was too dangerous.","[{'url': 'https://twitter.com/DJPAIMON/status/1268399580753858561', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwx86v/another_angle_of_the_police_firing_upon_us/', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwml8n/state_police_gassing_citizens/', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwaqzx/from_a_facebook_livestreamseems_like_peaceful/', 'text': ''}, {'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwc763/iowa_city_pd_gassed_and_flashbanged_their_own/', 'text': ''}]"
