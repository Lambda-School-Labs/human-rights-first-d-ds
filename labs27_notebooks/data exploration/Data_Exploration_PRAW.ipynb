Pedro Cano's family said he worked on the eastern Iowa pork processing plant's line in late March and April without a mask or gloves, according to a lawsuit filed in Johnson County District Court on Sept. 23. They also allege Cano worked elbow to elbow with other employees and did not receive guidance from his bosses about the threat of COVID 19. Cano began to feel symptoms of the virus on April 2, four days before the plant was closed because of rapidly spreading infections, according to the lawsuit. At the time, Tyson reported that 24 employees had tested positive for the virus, a figure that eventually ballooned to 522, according to the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Cano's family alleges gross negligence and fraudulent misrepresentation by Tyson, citing public comments from executives that the company was diligent about educating team members and needed to keep the plants open to supply food to grocery stores, even though at the time U.S. pork producers were shipping large amounts of pork to China. More 'If we lost Tyson, we lost everything' Iowa meatpacking plant both a COVID 19 risk and town's lifeblood Tyson, which formed a coronavirus task force in January, told some white collar employees to work from home on March 17. In response to the news of the lawsuit, a company spokesman said in an email, We re saddened by the loss of any Tyson team member and sympathize with their families. Our top priority is the health and safety of our workers and we ve implemented a host of protective measures at our facilities that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance for preventing the virus. Currently, less than one half of one percent of our U.S. workforce has active Covid 19. Columbus Junction, a town of about 1,900, was the site of the first reported COVID 19 outbreak at an Iowa meatpacking plant. The Iowa Department of Public Health later disclosed outbreaks involving hundreds of Tyson workers in Perry, Storm Lake and Waterloo More Iowa OSHA acted appropriately on Tyson complaint, Gov. Kim Reynolds says Tyson implemented safety measures after the Columbus Junction plant closed April 6. The company began checking temperatures of employees as they arrived for work, gave them masks and gloves and erected plastic sheets to keep them separated on the line. In the lawsuit, Cano's children say Tyson should have taken these steps before their father got sick. They cite the U.S. Department of Labor's March 9 workplace safety guidance, which called for employers to come up with a way to detect COVID 19 symptoms, educate workers about how the virus spreads and give workers protective equipment. More 'A serious mistake' Union president criticizes Tyson Foods over attendance policy While many infected employees and their families have filed complaints against Tyson through workers' compensation cases, Cano's family is at least the fourth to file a civil lawsuit.

CNN's Evan Perez and Ariane De Vouge contributed to this report.\n","A case involving a Georgia teenager who was fatally shot by police has been classified as a homicide, concluding a monthslong investigation by a local medical examiner's office. Vincent Truitt, 17, was killed on July 13 when police attempted to stop him and two other teens who allegedly were riding in a stolen vehicle, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations. The driver led officers on a chase before pulling over, when two of the teens allegedly broke away on foot, investigators said. One of the them allegedly brandished a firearm, and an officer fired his gun, striking Truitt, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. It is my opinion that Vincent Truitt died as a result of multiple 2 gunshot wounds to the torso. Based on the information available at this time, the manner of death is classified as Homicide, the Cobb County Medical Examiner's Office said in a statement Monday. Gerald Griggs, an attorney for the slain teen's family, said Truitt got out of the vehicle and ran away from the officers, but he never brandished a weapon. Griggs is calling for the release of any body camera footage and or audio related to the shooting. This quest for Justice for VincentTruitt is about making sure his family gets answers. Vince was a 17 year old son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. His family deserves to know the truth about his death at the hands of Cobb police, Griggs tweeted after the medical examiner's announcement. In a separate tweet he added The Family of VincentTruitt demand the real facts about what happened to Vince. Help the family and follow justiceforvince for updates on the case and how to help. JusticeforVince. justicefighter. Griggs also shared an image of Truitt and his mother, Venethia Cook Lewis, along with images of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and other Black men killed by police. My child died alone, Cook Lewis told protesters at a rally over the weekend. No parent should have to go through what I'm going through. No parent should have to bury their son, their teenage son, due to something that could have been avoided. Cobb County police did not respond to ABC News' phone and e mail requests for comment, and the department has not shared any details about whether it will release bodycam footage. Speaking in a phone interview with Atlanta ABC affiliate WSB, Cobb County Police Chief Tim Cox said he hopes to have the case turned over to the local district attorney. I think what needs to be done is let the independent investigation be completed and turned over to the DA's office, Cox said. Griggs say Truitt's family is shaken up over the ruling. They plan to meet with the Cobb County District Attorney this week about possible criminal charges in light of the homicide ruling. The officer who fired his weapon was still on the police force as of Monday afternoon, according to WSB. The GBI said its investigation is ongoing. 24 7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n","Discover Thomson Reuters By Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli 7 Min Read NEW YORK Reuters Purdue Pharma LP, the OxyContin maker controlled by members of the wealthy Sackler family, is nearing an agreement to plead guilty to criminal charges as part of a broader deal to resolve U.S. Justice Department probes into its alleged role in fueling the nation s opioid crisis, six people familiar with the matter said. Purdue lawyers and federal prosecutors are brokering a plea deal that could be unveiled as soon as within the next two weeks and include billions of dollars of financial penalties, four of the people said. They stressed that talks are fluid and that some of the terms could change as discussions continue. In addition to the criminal case, U.S. prosecutors are negotiating a settlement of civil claims also carrying a financial penalty that allege unlawful conduct in Purdue s handling of prescription painkillers, they said. The Stamford, Connecticut based company is expected to face penalties exceeding 8 billion. They consist of a roughly 3.54 billion criminal fine, 2 billion criminal forfeiture and 2.8 billion civil penalty, some of the people familiar with the negotiations said. They are unlikely to be paid in the near term as the criminal fine and civil penalty are expected to be considered alongside other claims in Purdue s bankruptcy proceedings and the company lacks necessary funds to fully repay all creditors. The tentative agreement would draw a line under Purdue s criminal exposure for what prosecutors and state attorneys general have described as aggressive marketing of a highly addictive painkiller that minimized the drug s potential for abuse and overdosing. Over the years, Purdue reaped billions of dollars in profits from its opioids, enriching Sackler family members and funneling illegal kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies, federal prosecutors and state attorneys general have alleged. The company now faces thousands of lawsuits seeking damages to address a public health crisis that has ravaged U.S. communities. Purdue said it is cooperating with the investigations and in discussions to resolve them, but declined further comment. Representatives of Sackler family members controlling Purdue had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have denied allegations that they contributed to the opioid crisis. A Justice Department spokeswoman said it does not generally comment on investigations or settlement discussions, but added that Reuters understanding of the situation contains inaccuracies and is highly misleading without elaborating further. The Justice Department is prepared to waive a large portion of its 2 billion forfeiture claim as long as Purdue meets certain conditions. The first is that Purdue steer significant financial sums for combating the opioid epidemic to U.S. communities suing it over the crisis, two people said. The other is that it receive court approval for a reorganization plan transforming it into a public benefit company run on behalf of those communities and no longer controlled by the Sacklers. Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year facing an onslaught of litigation, is in discussions to plead guilty to charges that include conspiracy, violations of an anti kickback law and misbranding under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, two of the people said. A plea agreement would require approval of Purdue s bankruptcy judge. One of the negotiated terms of Purdue s proposal to settle thousands of other opioid lawsuits is that it resolve the Justice Department probes. Members of the Sackler family, many of whom previously served on Purdue s board and also face lawsuits, will avoid criminal charges in the looming settlement, the two people said. Certain family members are in discussions to pay a roughly 225 million civil penalty for allegedly causing false claims regarding Purdue s prescription painkillers to be filed with government healthcare programs, three people said. That would be on top of 3 billion the Sacklers have offered to settle other lawsuits. The current settlement under discussion does not resolve any future criminal liability the Sacklers or other individuals may face. The Justice Department is continuing a criminal probe of some Sackler family members and other individuals associated with Purdue, though it remains unclear whether charges will materialize, one person said. Details of the Justice Department settlement, including when it will be unveiled and the financial penalties, also remain in flux. They hinge in part on the outcome of separate negotiations among Purdue, the Sacklers, state attorneys general and others to resolve widespread litigation as part of mediation in the company s bankruptcy proceedings, individuals familiar with the talks said. Some state attorneys general, including those in Massachusetts and New York, have demanded the Sacklers disclose additional details of their finances and pay more than the 3 billion they offered to settle lawsuits. They are likely to scrutinize the size of the family s Justice Department penalty. The Sacklers are poised to receive a legal release should a bankruptcy judge approve a broader settlement, shielding them from future civil, though not criminal, claims. Purdue s bankruptcy has shielded, through an injunction, the company and Sackler family members until at least March 2021 from thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities, counties and others seeking to hold them responsible for allegedly flooding communities with opioid painkillers that contributed to widespread addiction and fatal overdoses. The company and family deny the allegations. The Sacklers controlling Purdue themselves have not filed for bankruptcy. That has drawn criticism from states arguing litigation against family members should proceed to hold them accountable for the opioid crisis. The outcome of settlement talks among Purdue, its owners and litigants will help determine how much money U.S. communities receive to address the toll from opioids. In earlier filings made as part of Purdue s bankruptcy case, federal prosecutors alleged the company at times paid doctors and pharmacies illegal kickbacks between 2010 and 2018 to encourage medically unnecessary opioid prescriptions, resulting in fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs, such as Medicare. Purdue has offered to settle widespread litigation in a deal it values at more than 10 billion, much of it linked to drugs under development to treat addiction and combat overdoses. One contentious aspect of the proposal is that some of the funds would come from continued OxyContin sales.

The 80 year old pastor received the diagnosis Friday and was recovering after the illness was detected early, Matt Hagee said during Sunday morning services at Cornerstone Church in San Antonio. John Hagee founded a ministry that the church says now has 22,000 members. His sermons are broadcast throughout the United States and Canada and livestreamed online. John Hagee has been a committed supporter of Israel, founding Christians United for Israel. He also is a stalwart backer of President Donald Trump, who with first lady Melania Trump also has been diagnosed with COVID 19. Trump was discharged Monday from Walter Reed Military Medical Center and returned to the White House, where his doctors said he would continue receiving treatment. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that he was praying for a fast recovery for John Hagee. Israel has no better friend, Netanyahu said. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and a cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. 24 7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n","Discover Thomson Reuters By Yereth Rosen 3 Min Read ANCHORAGE Reuters In Alaska s annual battle of heavyweights, a salmon chomping bruin named 747 like the jetliner has emerged as the most fabulously fat. The bear, one of more than 2,200 brown bears roaming Alaska s Katmai National Park and Preserve, was victorious on Tuesday after a week of frenzied online voting in what has become an international sensation Fat Bear Week. Winner 747 was a worthy champion, the park said in a statement. This year he really packed on the pounds, looking like he was fat enough to hibernate in July and yet continuing to eat until his belly seemed to drag along the ground by late September, the park said. Fat Bear Week pits 12 bears against each other in playoff style brackets. Bear fans compared photos and voted online for their favorites from last Wednesday to Tuesday night. For humans, Fat Bear Week is a fun way to learn, from a distance, about nature and Alaska. Katmai s bears can grow to well over 1,000 pounds 453 kg from summer feasting. They can also lose a third of their body weight during hibernation. That makes Fat Bear Week about survival of the fattest, as the Park Service puts it. Katmai, a 4 million acre park sprawling over mountains, lakes, streams and coastline, is famous for having the world s densest population of brown bears, the coastal version of grizzlies. Within Katmai, the Brooks River is a prime place for brown bears to feast. There, bears congregate in summer and fall to snatch salmon swimming upstream to spawning grounds, with much of the action captured by a webcam operated by explore.org, one of the Fat Bear Week partners. This year, the river was more of a bear paradise than usual, thanks to a record salmon run, said Naomi Doak, a media ranger at Katmai. What was scarce along the Brooks River was people. Peak summer normally sees about 500 visitors a day but with the coronavirus pandemic, that was down to 50 to 100, she said. The combination of the big salmon run and fewer people, this has really handed the river to the bears, she said.

Create a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive videos, sweepstakes, and more A survivor blasted the Sunday school pastor who molested and raped her as a child after he put in a request to be pardoned for the crime. I wanted to say to you personally, I am so tired of having to monitor and babysit you, Allison Black Cornelius said in a Facebook Live video she made on Thursday, directed at Leon Albert Prince. Prince, 76, molested and raped her multiple times in 1972 when she was just 7 years old, AL.com reports. He was a pastor at her Alabama church. She told AL.com last year that Prince had threatened to kill her dog if she didn t submit to the sexual abuse. While the horrendous acts were not reported at the time, as Cornelius grew up she told friends and loved ones, according to court records. When she feared that he was hurting other kids, she made an official report. While many others have accused Prince of abusing them when they were young, Cornelius who's now the executive director of the Greater Birmingham Humane Society was the only one who saw it all the way through the legal system. He was convicted in 1991 for carnal knowledge of a girl less than 12 years old, according to court records. He was sentenced to 30 years behind bars but only served 15. The former pastor was then released from prison in 2006. Now, Prince wants a pardon from the state of Alabama. After putting in an official request, he's expected to go before the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles in two weeks to explain why he deserves it, AL.com reports. This move has angered Cornelius, who said the news wears her out. It seems to me the very first person he would want to get a pardon from would be me or one of his other 52 victims,'' she says in her Facebook video, which is captioned A message to my rapist. He has never asked me, my family, or any of his other victims or their families for a pardon. Leon s ultimate pardon is between him and God. But his earthly request should be between Leon and his survivors, Cornelius told Oxygen.com over Facebook. In her video, she told him that he destroyed her and her family s lives. You were my youth pastor at Tarrant First Baptist Church when you did that, she said. My dad and my mom trusted you. You ve never once looked me in the eye and acknowledged what you did, she said, adding that she'd like Prince to directly tell her why he thinks he deserves a pardon. While she said she forgives Prince, she doesn't want him to be pardoned and is suspicious of his intentions. A pardon would remove his current sex offender status. It set off alarm bells for me because there would be one reason he wants a pardon and that s because he s trying to something that he cannot do because he is a registered sex offender,'' Cornelius said, according to AL.com. She vowed in her Facebook Live video to do whatever she needs to do to make sure he doesn't fall under the radar again. I'm sick of having to do it, she said.

The case has been brought by Keira Bell, who began taking puberty blockers when she was 16, and the mother of a 16 year old awaiting treatment. They are taking action against the UK's only children's NHS gender clinic, run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. The landmark hearing in London is expected to last two days. The Gender Identity Development Service GIDS , based in Hampstead, north west London, is a specialised unit for young people who have difficulties with their gender identity. Lawyers representing Ms Bell, 23, and Mrs A, whose autistic child is currently on the waiting list for treatment at the service, argue that children going through puberty are not capable of properly understanding the nature and effects of hormone blockers . They argue there is a very high likelihood that children who start taking hormone blockers will later begin taking cross sex hormones, which they say cause irreversible changes . Ms Bell and Mrs A are asking the High Court to rule that it is unlawful for children who wish to undergo gender reassignment to be prescribed hormone blockers without an order from the court that such treatment is in their best interests . Jeremy Hyam QC, who is representing the pair at the hearing, said The use of hormone blockers to address gender dysphoria does not have any adequate evidence base to support it. He said the effect of hormone blockers on the intensity, duration and outcome of adolescent development is largely unknown , adding There is evidence that hormone blockers can have significant side effects, including loss of fertility and sexual function and decreased bone density. In written submissions, Mr Hyam said That children are not capable of giving informed consent to undergo a type of medical intervention about which the evidence base is poor, the risks and potential side effects are still largely unknown, and which is likely to set them on a path towards permanent and life altering physical, psychological, emotional and developmental consequences... is the common sense and obvious position. He told the court that referrals to GIDS had seen a 20 fold increase , rising from 97 in 2009 to 2,590 in 2018. In a witness statement before the court, Ms Bell, who began detransitioning last year, said I made a brash decision as a teenager, as a lot of teenagers do, trying to find confidence and happiness, except now the rest of my life will be negatively affected. She added Transition was a very temporary, superficial fix for a very complex identity issue. Fenella Morris QC, lawyer for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, said the contention that children could not give informed consent to being prescribed hormone blockers was a radical proposition . She argued in written submissions that the claimants sought to impose a blanket exclusion on children under the age of 18 to be able to consent to medical treatment. Ms Morris added the majority of children referred to GIDS between March 2019 and 2020 were over 12, with only 13 of the children referred being under the age of 13. She accepted that hormone blockers were experimental but argued their use has been widely researched and debated for three decades , adding It is a safe and reversible treatment with a well established history. This is a controversial case with deeply held views on all sides. At the heart of it is the complex question of whether a child under the age of 18 can give informed consent to treatment that Keira Bell's lawyers describe as experimental and life altering . They say that with some children prescribed puberty blockers as young as nine or 10 although this is rare , they can't possibly know how they will feel as an adult if they face difficulties having a child or having a fulfilling sexual relationship. Lawyers for the Tavistock maintain there are careful checks and balances and, for years, such drugs have successfully given young people space to reflect before they transition. They are also likely to point to the many young transgender people who already have to wait years just to see a gender specialist and the deep distress that causes. Ms Morris also said the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust referred children and young people experiencing gender dysphoria to University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust or Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust. She argued that those two trusts were responsible for prescribing hormone blockers to children with gender dysphoria not the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. Lawyers representing London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust are expected to address the court on Thursday. It is expected that the judges hearing the case Dame Victoria Sharp, Mr Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven will reserve judgment to a later date.

Lake Jackson issued the notice late last month after the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality determined that the city's public water supply didn't meet the TCEQ's minimum disinfection standards throughout the entire system, reports CBS Houston affiliate KHOU TV. But, the station says, Lake Jackson and the TCEQ confirmed on Monday and Tuesday that the water supply was negative for harmful bacteria and deemed the city's tap water safe to drink. The TCEQ said disinfectant levels in the drinking water were documented to be above the state requirements. The amoeba Naegleria fowleri can't infect people who drink water because it's killed by normal levels of stomach acid. However, people can get infected when water contaminated with the amoeba enters the body through the nose. Once that happens, the amoeba can travel to the brain, where they may cause Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis. Residents don't have to boil the city's water prior to drinking it or cooking with it but are still urged to avoid getting water up their noses, to reduce the risk of Naegleria fowleri infection, Lake Jackson and the TCEQ said. The boil water notice was issued late last month after several days of flushing of the Brazosport Water Authority's water delivery system. The flushing was ordered after three of 11 samples of the Lake Jackson's water tested positive for the deadly flagellate. One sample came from the home of Josiah McIntyre, the 6 year old boy whom doctors said died last month after being infected with the brain eating parasite, city officials said. McIntyre's mother said he became ill with flu like symptoms first, but his condition soon deteriorated to the point where he was having trouble standing and communicating, CBS Dallas Fort Worth reports. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who issued a disaster declaration for Lake Jackson, has said all indications point to the case being isolated and that the suspected problem in the boy's death was traced back to a splash pad. The TCEQ said it and the city will conduct daily monitoring for the microbe going forward. The Brazosport Water Authority initially warned eight communities on Sept. 25 not to use tap water for any reason except to flush toilets. It lifted that warning the next day for all communities but Lake Jackson, where the authority's water treatment plant is situated. The advisory also was canceled for two state prisons and Dow Chemical's massive Freeport works. The ban was lifted in Lake Jackson on Sept. 27 but replaced with the boil water notice.
